/* It is important to know that the scale property 
does not cause other elements to flow around it like the 
scale() transform function does. That means an elementâ€™s 
scale does not result in the elements around it reflowing 
in order to make additional (or less) room available based on 
the scale of that element.*/

/* That's why, adding transform to #box does not move the border of the #box-container*/
